This circuit is designed on request and can be useful to those wishing to have,say,a red LED illuminated when an appliance is on and a green LED illuminated when the same appliance is off.Any mains operated appliance can be monitored by this circuit provided a suitable mains switch, capable of with standing the full load current, is used for SW1. When SW1 is close,the load and D4 are energinized, Q1 is saturated and shorts D3, thus preventing its illumination.
